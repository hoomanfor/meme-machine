# Meme Machine

This is 'Meme Machine': [guarded-gorge-23984.herokuapp.com](https://guarded-gorge-23984.herokuapp.com/)  

Use 'Meme Machine' to create memes. Once you design a meme, save it to your personal library. In the future, I plan on adding more meme design features and a way to share memes on a public page.  

This project was developed using the MVC architectural design pattern. Technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and mySQL. To name a few, NPM packages include Express, Handlebars.js, Passport.js, and Sequelize.
